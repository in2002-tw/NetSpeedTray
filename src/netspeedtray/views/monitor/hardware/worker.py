HardwareActivityWorker - per-process CPU / RAM / GPU sampler for the Monitor's Hardware tab.

Honest, admin-free, and every number measured (not estimated):
  * CPU%  - psutil per-process, summed across a program's PIDs, normalized to total-CPU (0-100%).
  * RAM   - psutil USS (Unique Set Size = private resident memory), summed across PIDs. This is what
            Task Manager's "Memory" column shows; rss would double-count shared DLLs across a
            multi-process app and read 2-3x high. USS is heavier to read, so it's refreshed every
            ~6s (every 3rd poll) and cached, while CPU%/GPU% stay on the 2s cadence.
  * GPU%  - Windows PDH "\GPU Engine(*)\Utilization Percentage", parsed pid_<PID>_..._engtype_ and
            reduced with MAX across that PID's engines - the per-engine busy fractions overlap in the
            same wall-clock interval (a frame uses 3D + Copy + Video at once) so they are NOT
            additive; max mirrors the app's system-wide _poll_gpu_hybrid. No admin, no ETW. Absent
            gracefully when the GPU Engine counter set isn't present (non-Windows / odd drivers).

Runs in a dedicated QThread, only while the Hardware tab is visible. The first sample is a baseline
(psutil cpu_percent needs two reads, PDH rate counters need two collects), so CPU/GPU read ~0 on the
very first emit and settle on the next.
