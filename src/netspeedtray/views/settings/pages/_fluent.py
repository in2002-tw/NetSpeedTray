"""
Shared Fluent helpers for the Settings pages.

The 2.0 Settings pages are built from one idiom - a small section caption over a stack of
``SettingCard`` rows (the native Win11 Settings layout) - instead of the old ``QGroupBox`` frames.
This module holds the one piece that ``components.SettingCard`` doesn't: the section caption that
groups related cards. Keeping it here means every page renders the same heading at the same size,
color and inset.
