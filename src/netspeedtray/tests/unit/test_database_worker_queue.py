"""
DatabaseWorker queue mechanics (H2) + flush barrier (H3).

H2: the worker uses a blocking queue.Queue (no 100ms busy-poll) and drains pending tasks
before honoring stop. H3: a "__signal__" task is a FIFO flush barrier - once it fires, every
persist enqueued before it is on disk, so a reader sees freshly-flushed samples.
