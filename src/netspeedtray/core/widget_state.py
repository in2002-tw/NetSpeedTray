"""
Manages the application's data layer, including in-memory state and SQLite persistence.

This module defines `WidgetState`, which acts as the main interface for the application's
data, and `DatabaseWorker`, a dedicated QThread for all database write and maintenance
operations to ensure the UI remains responsive.

Key Features:
- Manages an in-memory deque of recent speeds for the real-time mini-graph.
- Stores granular, per-interface network speed data in a multi-tiered SQLite database.
- Implements a multi-tier aggregation strategy:
  - Per-second data is kept for 24 hours.
  - Per-minute aggregates are kept for 30 days.
  - Per-hour aggregates are kept for up to 1 year.
- Handles user-configurable data retention with a 48-hour grace period for reductions.
- Performs all database writes and maintenance (pruning, aggregation, VACUUM) in a
  dedicated background thread to prevent UI blocking.
- Guarantees data integrity through the use of atomic transactions.

        Each worker thread (notably the Monitor's GraphDataWorker, recreated on every Monitor open) opens
        its own read connection here, removed otherwise only in cleanup() at exit. Without pruning, every
        Monitor open/close leaked a connection (a file handle + a WAL reader slot) for the whole session,
        and a recycled thread id could even hand a new worker a dead thread's stale connection. So evict
        entries whose owning thread has stopped using them.

        **Pruning is by IDLE TIME, not by thread liveness, and that is not a stylistic choice.** This
        used to evict any connection whose thread id was missing from ``threading.enumerate()`` - but
        Qt worker threads (``QThread``) never appear there unless they happen to call
        ``threading.current_thread()``, and ours only call ``get_ident()``. So every Monitor graph
        worker was invisible, and the next caller from any other thread closed its connection **while
        it was still querying** - "Cannot operate on a closed database", caught and logged, once per
        Monitor session.

        Registering the thread instead (calling ``current_thread()``) is worse: on CPython 3.11 the
        resulting ``_DummyThread`` never leaves ``enumerate()`` when the native thread dies, so
        nothing would ever be pruned and the leak this exists to prevent comes straight back
        (verified, not assumed).

        A thread mid-query has just fetched its connection, so an idle threshold it cannot trip is
