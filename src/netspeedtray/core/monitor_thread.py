"""
Background Hardware Monitor Thread for NetSpeedTray.

This module provides a dedicated QThread for polling system statistics:
- Network I/O (via psutil)
- CPU Utilization (via psutil)
- GPU Utilization (via Windows PDH)

Offloading this I/O from the main UI thread ensures consistent 60+ FPS widget movement
and prevents micro-stutters during system stack latency.
