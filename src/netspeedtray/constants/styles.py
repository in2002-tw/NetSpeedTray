Constants defining specific UI element styles, like colors and stylesheets.

This file serves as the "design token" repository for the application. It should
only contain raw, static values (e.g., hex color codes). The construction of
actual QSS stylesheets from these tokens is handled by functions in `utils/styles.py`.
