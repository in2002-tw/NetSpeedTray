# Translators

NetSpeedTray's UI is available in 14 languages - including Hebrew, its first right-to-left locale - thanks to the community contributors below. Each name represents real time and care invested in making the app feel native to its users - thank you.

If you'd like to contribute a translation or improve an existing one, see the locale files in [`src/netspeedtray/constants/locales/`](src/netspeedtray/constants/locales/) and open a pull request. The `en_US.json` file is the source of truth - all other locales must keep key parity with it (enforced by [`test_locales_parity.py`](src/netspeedtray/tests/unit/test_locales_parity.py)).

Other locales (English, German, Spanish) are currently maintained by the project owner. Native-speaker reviews are very welcome - even one-line corrections to phrasing or terminology are valuable.

> ℹ️ **About AI-assisted strings:** Strings added for features released *after* a translator's most recent contribution (e.g. the App Activity window, Support Bundle, and Preferred Monitor) have been filled in with **machine / AI-assisted translation** so every language stays complete and usable. These AI-assisted strings are **not** the work of the human translators credited above, and they have **not** yet been reviewed by a native speaker. If you spot an awkward or incorrect one, a one-line correction PR is hugely appreciated - and you'll be credited for it.

> 🆕 **Pending native review for 2.0** (non-English values AI-assisted; a one-line native check before the 2.0 tag is very welcome - see issue #157):
> - Tray "data used" glance: `USAGE_TODAY_LABEL`, `USAGE_THIS_MONTH_LABEL`
> - Update dialog / one-click updater: `UPDATE_RELEASE_NOTES_LABEL`, `UPDATE_DOWNLOADING_TITLE`, `UPDATE_FALLBACK_MESSAGE`
> - First-run welcome: `WELCOME_2_0_TITLE`, `WELCOME_2_0_BODY`, `WELCOME_2_0_WHATS_NEW_BUTTON`, `WELCOME_2_0_GOT_IT_BUTTON` (the **body** is the longest/most nuanced - most worth a look)
> - **Monitor window (Overview / Network / Hardware tabs):** `GRAPH_HW_UTIL_AXIS_LABEL`, `MEMORY_HEADER`, `HARDWARE_LOADING_MESSAGE`, `HARDWARE_NO_DATA_MESSAGE`, and `HARDWARE_SUMMARY_TEMPLATE` (**keep every `{…}` field - `{procs}`, `{cpu:.0f}`, `{ram:.1f}`, `{ram_unit}`, `{updated_at}`**). Drafts were grounded in your existing terms (e.g. "Utilization" follows your `GRAPH_CPU_UTIL_AXIS_LABEL`). `MONITOR_TILE_RAM` / `MONITOR_TILE_VRAM` are acronyms left as-is - localize only if your language does.

> 🆕 **Pending native review for Hebrew (2.1):** `he_IL` was seeded by [@rami123](https://github.com/rami123) (~74 strings); the remaining ~300 were AI-assisted for the 2.1 RTL work, each checked to preserve its `{…}` placeholders. The whole locale is **pending a native-speaker pass** - Hebrew is the app's first right-to-left language, so both the wording and any RTL layout quirks are worth a look. Corrections are hugely welcome and credited.

## How translation works in NetSpeedTray

- Each locale lives in a single JSON file under [`src/netspeedtray/constants/locales/`](src/netspeedtray/constants/locales/)
- Keys must match `en_US.json` exactly (the parity test fails the build otherwise)
- Values can use Python format-string placeholders like `{file_path}` or `{error}` - **preserve these verbatim.** A translation that drops a value placeholder or invents a new one fails CI ([`test_placeholder_parity.py`](src/netspeedtray/tests/unit/test_placeholder_parity.py)), because it would crash `.format()` at runtime. (Grammar helpers like `{plural}` may be dropped if your language doesn't pluralize that way.)
- For new keys added by a feature PR, non-English values are first filled with a machine / AI-assisted translation (or, failing that, an English placeholder) so the parity test passes and users get an as-localized-as-possible UI right away. As noted above, these AI-assisted strings are **not** attributed to the credited human translators and are pending native-speaker review - follow-up correction PRs are very welcome

### Finding what needs translation

Every locale is kept in the **exact same key order as `en_US.json`** - so the same line number is the same key in every file. To see what's new or changed for your language:

- **Side-by-side:** open your `xx_XX.json` next to `en_US.json`; matching lines are matching keys.
- **What changed since the last release:** `git diff v1.3.3 -- src/netspeedtray/constants/locales/en_US.json` shows every English string added or reworded (a reworded source means your existing translation is now stale - worth a re-check).
- The maintainer also posts a digest of new/changed strings to the translation thread ([#157](https://github.com/erez-c137/NetSpeedTray/issues/157)) when a batch lands, so you can reply there or open a PR - whichever is easier.
